path\to\SLOctolyzer 

# This file `conda.pth` will allow your Python environment to have access to the files in your local copy of SLOctolyzer.
# Change the file path above to the absolute file path to SLOctolyzer. For example, for Windows native I'd write 
# C:\Users\s1522100\Documents\PhD Work\Github\SLOctolyzer
# Copy this file into the `site-packages` directory of your python environment, commonly found at
# path\to\miniconda3\envs\oct-analysis\Lib\site-packages
# This means your conda environment `sloctolyzer` has access to SLOctolyzer's pipeline.
# Importantly, you can now use `import sloctolyzer` in any notebook or python script which uses this conda environment.
# Remove these 8 lines once you corrected the directory path on line 1
